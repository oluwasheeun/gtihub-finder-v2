# Github Finder v2 App

This is a React.js App to search GitHub profiles and view profile details. The app is similar to the version 1 built in 2020 [here](https://github.com/oluwasheeun/github-User-Finder) and is part of [Brad Traversy](https://traversymedia.com) "React Front To Back 2022" udemy course.

TailwindCSS & DaisyUI were used to get the beautiful modern UI.

## Usage

Rename **_.env.example_** to **_.env_**

You can use the Github API without a personal token, but if you want to use your token, add it to the .env file
